# 3D Wetlands App
<p>Application to visualize and compare land cover changes over the wetland areas of the Northern Gulf of Mexico and Florida produced with WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellite imagery (2 m per pixel). This product has a temporal coverage from 2009 to 2018 (not consistent over time). The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) product at 2-m resolution was built with airborne topographic Lidar surveys over the wetland and coastal areas.</p>

# 3D Wetlands App
<p>Google Earth Engine (GEE) Application to visualize and compare land cover changes and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) over the wetland areas of the Northern Gulf of Mexico and Florida at very high-resolutions.</p>

## Introduction:
The 3D Wetlands App provide access to two large collections, (1) Landcover and (2) DEM, ingested to Earth Engine. The landcover product offer access to 12,929 processed and classified imagery at 2 m per pixel from WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellites, with temporal coverage from 2009 to 2018 (this is not consistent over time).

Satellite imagery coverage:

The images are classified in the next classes:

The DEM product was built with 178 airborne topographic Lidar surveys (bare-earth) over the wetland and coastal areas of the Northern Gulf of Mexico and Florida. This product has horizontal resolution of 2-m per pixel and vertical accuracy of 0.2 m.

## Features:
This app allows to create and compare land cover mosaics of two user-defined periods in one or more selected Counties. The DEM will show up for the selected areas in 

## FAQ
Do I need a Google Earth Engine account to use the app?
Do I have access to the landcover and DEM collections?
Can I download the generated mosaics and DEM trough the app?


## Disclaimer:
The 3D Wetlands App provide access to processed satellite imagery and LiDAR data as a tool for public and academic use. The raw satellite data is property of DigitalGlobe.

## Credits:
The WorldView imagery was processed at the Institute for Marine Remote Sensing (IMARS) at the College of Marine Science, University of South Florida and the DEM was acquired by the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi. Google Earth Engine is the platform where the data stored and distributed.

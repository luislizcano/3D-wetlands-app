# 3D Wetlands App
<p>Google Earth Engine Application to visualize and compare land cover changes over the wetland areas of the Northern Gulf of Mexico and Florida produced with WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellite imagery (2 m per pixel). This product has a temporal coverage from 2009 to 2018 (not consistent over time). The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) product at 2-m resolution was built with airborne topographic Lidar surveys over the wetland and coastal areas.</p>

## Introduction:
The 3D Wetlands App is GEE App 
## Features:
This app allows to create and compare land cover mosaics of two user-defined periods in one or more selected Counties. The DEM will show up for the selected areas in 



## Disclaimer:
The 3D Wetlands App provide access to processed satellite imagery and LiDAR data as a tool for public and academic use. The raw satellite data is property of DigitalGlobe.

## Credits:
The WorldView imagery was processed at the Institute for Marine Remote Sensing (IMARS) at the College of Marine Science, University of South Florida and the DEM was acquired by the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi. Google Earth Engine is the platform where the data stored and distributed.
